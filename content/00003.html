<h1> back propagation </h1>
<br/>
Back propagation is a technique used in the training of artificial neural networks. It is the core of many machine learning algorithms, and is useful for optimizing the weights of a neural network to produce accurate predictions. Back propagation can be used for supervised learning tasks such as classification, regression, and pattern recognition. It works by propagating the errors of each neuron in the network backwards, updating the weights of the network to minimize the error. In this way, the network is able to learn from its mistakes and gradually improve its performance.</body>
